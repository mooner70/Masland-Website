            <p>At Masland Contract, we understand that true design requires a balance between the aesthetic and the
              practical. Our clear insight into the designer’s perspective is one reason Masland Contract is a highly
              respected leader in the industry—our reputation for innovation is another reason leading design firms
              partner with Masland.
              <br>
              Guided by a design sense that has been refined by more than a century of experience, we not only
              recognize new trends as they emerge, we originate trends which others follow. Our creativity then finds
              expression in products of extraordinary quality and superb craftsmanship. The result: interior
              environments that are as functional as they are beautiful.</p>
